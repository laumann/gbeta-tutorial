			INSTALLATION of gbeta
			---------------------

Please refer to the instructions on the webpage 

  http://cs.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta/index_installation.html

That page is also available as part of the distribution.  If you 
cannot access the page on the Internet, just untar the gbeta archive

  gzip -d -c gbeta-1.9.9-src.tgz | tar xf -

(this command works on the source archive, but the binary archives 
can be unpacked with similar commands) and look at the installation 
instructions in gbeta-1.9.9/html/index_installation.html.
