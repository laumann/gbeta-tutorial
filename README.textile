h1. gbeta

This gbeta tutorial is designed to teach -- wait for it -- gbeta! gbeta is a programming in the old-school nordic tradition of Simula, based on BETA, developed as a PhD project by Erik Ernst at Ã…rhus University. The tutorial is an attempt to teach gbeta to readers unfamiliar with the ideas inherited from BETA. The only prerequisite should be a basic understanding of OO programming. 

For more information about gbeta and its implementation, please take a look at the web site:

  "http://www.cs.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta":http://www.cs.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta

This project is not meant to explain how to install gbeta, or BETA for that matter, but rather explain to the uninitiated, the basic concepts that govern gbeta, and demonstrate how to use them.

h2. Jekyll

This tutorial is made with "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com with additional plugins (can be found in the @_plugins@ folder)

First of all an extended version of RedCloth is used, adding in the ability to write:

bc. gbprog. hello.gb

and the converter will look for the file @hello.gb@ in @/tutorial/gbsrc/@ and insert its contents.
