h1. gbeta Tutorial

This gbeta tutorial is designed to teach -- wait for it -- gbeta! gbeta is a programming in the old-school nordic tradition of Simula, based on BETA, developed as a PhD project by Erik Ernst at Ã…rhus University.

h2. Jekyll

This tutorial is made with "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com with additional plugins (can be found in the @_plugins@ folder)

First of all an extended version of RedCloth is used, adding in the ability to write:

bc. gbprog. hello.gb

and the converter will look for the file @hello.gb@ in @/gbeta-tutorial/gbsrc/@ and insert its contents.
