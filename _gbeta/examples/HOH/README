This example is a complete, runnable version of the examples in the
following paper:

@InProceedings{EE03,
  author =       {Erik Ernst},
  title =        {Higher-Order Hierarchies},
  pages =        {},
  editor =       {Luca Cardelli},
  booktitle =    {Proceedings {ECOOP}'2003},
  address =      {Darmstadt, Germany},
  month =        jul,
  year =         2003,
  series =       "Lecture Notes in Computer Science",
  volume =       "2743",
  publisher =    "Springer-Verlag",
}

To try it out, use

  gbeta example.gb

or, in Emacs (with the libraries loaded as explained in ../../emacs):

  Load example.gb in a buffer
  M-x gbeta [ENTER][ENTER]

The file expression2.gb shows the examples concerned with hierarchy
modification (changing the structure of hierarchies).  It can be
inspected by

  gbeta expression2.gb

or

  Load expression2.gb in an Emacs buffer
  M-x gbeta [ENTER][ENTER]

The patterns in expression2.gb give rise to a compile time warning,
as explained in the paper and at the ECOOP 2003 conference, because
the full language gbeta allows for dynamic pattern merging.  If we
were to take dynamic pattern merging out of the language then this
file would still be within the language, and there would be no
danger of run-time errors.
