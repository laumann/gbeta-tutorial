\begin{abstract}
  This is a book written to teach \gbeta . \gbeta is a generalization
  of \beta created by Erik Ernst at Aarhus University as the theme of
  his ph.d. thesis. \gbeta is implemented in \beta and as such, to
  understand \gbeta it is (somewhat) necessary to know \beta . This
  document aims to overcome this, and introduce the underlying
  concepts that \gbeta inherits directly from \beta , but without
  demanding any knowledge of \beta . In other words, the aim of this
  document is to teach \gbeta from the bottom. The only knowledge I
  will rely on is the understanding of object-oriented
  programming.

  To sum up, I seek to introduce the concepts of \gbeta along with
  actual examples to illustrate the (possible) applications of these
  concepts.

\chapter{Motivation}

The motivation for writing this tutorial is mainly to combine the
learning material found at \url{http://www.daimi.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta},
Erik Ernst's own PhD thesis \cite{ernst99b} and the \beta book. In \gbeta version
1.9.8 the syntax has changed considerably, and \beta programs are
no longer valid \gbeta programs. The syntax change is partly to
conform to mainstream conventions (for instance using \verb|{ ... }| to denote
block structure) and to reduce the level of verbosity \beta (and
therefore alo \gbeta ) programs had a tendency to attain.

The outline of the book is as follows (subject to change):

\begin{description}\setlength{\itemsep}{-2pt}
\item[Assumptions] It's important to keep one's assumptions in mind. I
  assume the reader is familiar with object-oriented programming as a
  concept. Also I don't intend to explain how to install \gbeta . For
  information on how to obtain a working \gbeta compiler please refer
  to \url{http://www.daimi.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta}.
\item[Objects and Patterns] First we need to introduce the main concepts. The
  pattern will be introduced as the spear-heading abstraction
  introduced in \beta and preserved in \gbeta . Also the relation of
  patterns to object, how an object may be obtained from a pattern
  will be described
\item[Mixins] The concept of mixins should maybe be included. The
  question is: Is it relevant to the programmer? This determines
  whether or not it should be included.
\item[Virtual patterns] Introduce virtuals and their use.
\item[The fragment language] This can almost be included directly from
  Erik's website.
\end{description}

Note on the structure of the book: Consider dividing into two parts;
the first part should be the tutorial---all that is necessary for a
programmer to know to program in \gbeta . The second part should be
information aimed at the more language design curious reader. How are
things implemented and understood in \gbeta ?
