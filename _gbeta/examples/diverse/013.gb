// This program demonstrates the basic technique of having ORIGIN in 
// betaenv (the standard environment, even though it is extremely 
// minimal in this case). The piece of code named "program" may be 
// considered to be inserted into 'betaenv.gb', thus replacing the 
// marker <<SLOT program:merge>> in that file.  Because of that, 
// 'puttext' is in the environment and may therefore be invoked
