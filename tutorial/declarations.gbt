h1. Declarations and Basic Types

This section deals with introducing the reader to the basic types of
gbeta, and through an example get an idea of what is already available
in the language

h2. Basic Types

There are x basic types in gbeta:

* int
* float
* bool
* string

h2. Declarations

How do you declare a type in gbeta? Give examples of various
declarations in gbeta (even some that don't make much sense at the
moment

The syntactic element for describing attributes is a
_declaration_. The basic syntax of a declaration is the following:

bc(block). Name : Entity

where @Name@ can be any chosen string that doesn't begin with a 

The following are all declarations:

bc(block). Account: %{ ... };
myAccount: @Account;
balance: @int;
const: %(|'Hello');
sqrt: %(i:int|i*i) { 'squaring a number'|stdio }

In general, the @:@ syntax denotes a name being associated with
an entity.

I need me another gbeta program:

gbprog. hello2.gb

From here I can link to the "previous":{% gbeta_tutorial prev %} or
the "next":{% gbeta_tutorial next %} without knowing what exactly they
are. Genius!
