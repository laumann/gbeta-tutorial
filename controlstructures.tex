\section{The \texttt{if} statement}

An \texttt{if} statement is a conditional statement, where a program's
behaviour can be switched based on a boolean expression. An \texttt{if}
statement can look in one of the two following ways:

\begin{verbatim}
  if <Evaluation> do { <Statements> }
\end{verbatim}
or:
\begin{verbatim}
  if <Evaluation> do { <Statements> }
  else { <Statements> }
\end{verbatim}
