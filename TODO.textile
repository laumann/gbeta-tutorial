h1. ToDo

* handle faulty gbeta programs (in gbeta.cgi), what should be returned if gbeta fails?
* set max-height for gbeta output/error boxes
* implement proper syntax highlight for gbeta in CodeMirror (new mode and accompanying css)

h1. Unlikely

h3. Custom link tags

* implement in GbetaTextile:
** @"next":tut_next@ #=> links next page in tutorial...
** @"previous":tut_prev@ #=> links to the previous page in tutorial...
** Otherwise just standard Textile linking functionality

*Because:* Even though we have access to the order of tutorial pages, we don't know at a given link tag, which page we are actually working on. From what I can see, the name of the file and its content are separated in @page.rb@ in Jekyll, which means such a functionality in the tutorial's custom Textile converter, should be changed to a generator instead.

h1. Fixed ToDo items

* create Jekyll generator to handle timestamp issue with gbeta's metagrammar
  @cp -f --preserve=timestamps gbeta/grammar/metagrammar/* _site/gbeta/grammar/metagrammar@
* insert hide button to show whenever output is shown (for hiding it again)
* handle '+' character being stolen from program text in POST (HIGH priority)
* style the output sections properly ... (css)
* expand @{% gbeta_tutorial %}@ with the following options:
  @{% gbeta_tutorial [next|prev|first] %}@ returns:
  if optional argument omitted, the gbeta_tutorial pager,
  else if 'next': the path to the next file in the tutorial
  else if 'prev': the path to the previous file in the tutorial
  else if 'first': the path to the first file in the tutorial
  else error
  The path returned when the argument is given is @/tutorial/<name of next/prev/first>.html@
