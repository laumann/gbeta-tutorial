# create Jekyll generator to handle timestamp issue with gbeta's metagrammar
  (cp -f --preserve=timestamps gbeta/grammar/metagrammar/* _site/gbeta/grammar/metagrammar)
# implement in GbetaTextile:
## "next":tut_next #=> links next page in tutorial...
## "previous":tut_prev #=> links to the previous page in tutorial...
## Otherwise just standard Textile linking functionality
# insert hide button to show whenever output is shown (for hiding it again)
# handle '+' character being stolen from program text in POST (HIGH priority)
# handle faulty gbeta programs (in gbeta.cgi), what should be returned if gbeta fails?
# style the output sections properly ... (css)
