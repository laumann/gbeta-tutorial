// A "computed object evaluation" is an expression that ends in a '!'.
// The meaning of 'x!' is: evaluate 'x' (which must deliver exactly 
// one object reference) then use the resulting object.  So the 
// expressions below will operate on the string 's'.  In the last
// case we use 6 '!' operators, every one of them operating on the same 
// object, namely the temporary instance of the main part { .. } in
// the last three lines of the do-part.  Finally, the [] operator 
// retrieves a reference to that same object, and the computed remote,
// '(...).test' performs a lookup operation on that object.  That 
// lookup finds the method 'test' and invokes it, and that method 
// prints "test object ref. case"
