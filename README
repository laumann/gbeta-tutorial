This is a tutorial for the programming language gbeta, a
generalisation of BETA, created by Erik Ernst. The tutorial is an
attempt to teach gbeta to readers unfamiliar with the ideas inherited
from BETA. The only prerequisite should be a basic understanding of OO
programming. 

For more information about gbeta and its implementation, please take
a look at the web site:

  http://www.cs.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta

This project is not meant to explain how to install gbeta, or BETA for
that matter, but rather explain to the uninitiated, the basic concepts
that govern gbeta, and demonstrate how to use them.

Feedback and contributions to this work are highly appreciated,
although one should keep in mind that the author(s) will be learning
the language while writing this tutorial. As such, new additions to
this manual may be reverted or modified if the other authors find it
incomprehensible or unclear.

This project is also about establishing a discussion on how to teach
new OO programming concepts to new students.
